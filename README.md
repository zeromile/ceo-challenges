### Day 9 Challenge ###

1. Create a `day09_challenges` folder
3. Inside the `day09_challenges` folder:
    1. Create an `index.html` file
    2. Create an `img` folder
    3. Create a `css` folder
4. Inside the `day09/css` folder 
    1. Create a `styles.css` file
    2. Create a `nav.css` file
5. Open the empty `day09/index.html` file and copy and paste the code from the `index.html` that is in this repo (see the files above, yo!) - do the same for the `styles.css` and the `nav.css` files
6. Follow the instructions (1-7) in the `index.html` file to "ADD" or "EDIT" the content
7. Edit the CSS to convert the navigation to use "flex" and not "display-block" (aka "floated blocks")
8. Add a media query in the `nav.css` file that will force the navigation elements to be vertical and not horizontal when the browser window shrinks below `800px` (there is an example of this in the `styles.css` file)

## Please review notes in the CSS files to help provide a reference for this challenge. ##
