### Day 9 ###

Please review notes in the CSS files to help provide a reference for this challenge.

1. Follow the instructions (1-7) in the `index.html` file to "ADD" or "EDIT" the content
2. Edit the CSS to convert the navigation to use "flex" and not "display-block" (aka "floated blocks")
3. Add a media query in the `nav.css` file that will force the navigation elements to be vertical and not horizontal when the browser window shrinks below `800px` (there is an example of this in the `styles.css` file)
